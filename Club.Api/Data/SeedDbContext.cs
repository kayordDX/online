                    # The Essential Rules of Golf: A Quick Reference Guide

                    ## 1. Core Principles

                    * **Play the course as you find it:** Don't alter the terrain, bend branches, or break growing things to improve your lie.
                    * **Play the ball as it lies:** Don't move, touch, or improve the position of your ball unless a specific rule allows it.
                    * **Act with integrity:** Golf relies on the player to be honest, call penalties on themselves, and play by the spirit of the game.

                    ---

                    ## 2. Teeing Area

                    * **Stay within the boundaries:** You must tee off between the two tee markers and no more than **two club-lengths** behind them. You *cannot* tee off in front of the markers.
                    * **Accidental knocks:** If your ball falls off the tee before you’ve made a stroke (a swing intended to hit the ball), you can re-tee it without penalty.

                    ---

                    ## 3. General Area & Bunker Rules

                    ### Fairway and Rough

                    * **Identifying your ball:** You may lift your ball to identify it, but you must mark its spot first and not clean it any more than necessary to see your mark.
                    * **Loose impediments:** You can remove natural objects (leaves, stones, twigs) anywhere on the course, including in bunkers and penalty areas, as long as your ball doesn't move.

                    ### Bunkers (Sand Traps)

                    * **No touching the sand:** You *cannot* touch the sand with your hand or club directly in front of or behind the ball, during a practice swing, or during your backswing.
                    * **Unplayable ball in bunker:** If you declare your ball unplayable, you can drop a ball in the bunker for a **1-stroke penalty**, or drop *outside* the bunker going back on a straight line from the pin for a **2-stroke penalty**.

                    ---

                    ## 4. Penalty Areas (Red and Yellow Hazards)

                    If your ball lands in a water hazard or designated penalty area, you have options:

                    1. **Play it as it lies:** You can play the ball out of the hazard without grounding your club penalty-free.
                    2. **Relief options (1-stroke penalty):**
                    * **Stroke-and-Distance:** Go back and replay the shot from where you last hit.
                    * **Back-on-the-line:** Drop a ball any distance behind the penalty area, keeping the point where the ball crossed into the hazard directly between you and the hole.
                    * **Lateral Relief (Red Hazards Only):** Drop within **two club-lengths** of where the ball last crossed the edge of the penalty area, no closer to the hole.

                    ---

                    ## 5. Putting Green

                    * **Marking and cleaning:** You may lift, mark, and clean your ball once it is on the putting green.
                    * **Repairing damage:** You can repair ball marks, old hole plugs, and damage from spike shoes, but you cannot repair natural wear or aeration holes.
                    * **Hitting the flagstick:** There is **no penalty** if you putt from the green and your ball hits the flagstick left in the hole.

                    ---

                    ## 6. Out of Bounds (OB) and Lost Balls

                    * **Search time:** You have a maximum of **3 minutes** to search for a ball before it is officially lost.
                    * **Out of Bounds:** Marked by white stakes or lines.
                    * **Standard Procedure (1-stroke penalty):** You must take "Stroke-and-Distance" relief. Go back to where you hit the previous shot and hit again.
                    * *Alternative Local Rule:* If in effect, you can drop a ball in the fairway adjacent to where your ball went out of bounds or was lost, taking a **2-stroke penalty**.

                    ---

                    ## 7. Taking Relief (Dropping the Ball)

                    When taking relief (free or penalty), follow the **Rule of Knee**:

                    * **The Drop:** Hold the ball at **knee height** and let it drop straight down.
                    * **Relief Area:** The ball must land in and stay within the designated relief area (usually 1 or 2 club-lengths, depending on the rule).
                    * **If it rolls away:** If the dropped ball rolls out of the relief area, drop it a second time. If it happens again, place the ball exactly where it first struck the ground on the second drop.

                    ---

                    ## Quick Penalty Reference Table

                    | Situation | Penalty | Action |
                    | --- | --- | --- |
                    | **Accidental ball movement by player** | 1 Stroke | Replace the ball on its original spot |
                    | **Ball completely lost / Out of Bounds** | 1 Stroke + Distance | Return to previous spot to re-play |
                    | **Taking relief from a Penalty Area** | 1 Stroke | Use back-on-the-line or lateral relief |
                    | **Declaring a ball unplayable** | 1 Stroke | Take relief within 2 club-lengths or back-on-the-line |
                    | **Playing the wrong ball** | 2 Strokes (Match play: Loss of hole) | Correct the mistake by finding and playing your ball |

                    # The Essential Rules of Padel: A Quick Reference Guide

                    ## 1. Court & Equipment Basics

                    * **The Setup:** Padel is almost exclusively played as a **doubles game** (2 vs 2) on an enclosed court that is roughly 25% smaller than a traditional tennis court.
                    * **Underhand Only:** All serves must be hit underhand.
                    * **The Walls:** The glass and mesh walls enclosing the court are active parts of the game, meaning the ball can be played off them under specific conditions.

                    ---

                    ## 2. The Serve

                    * **Positioning:** The server must stand behind the service line and stay to the left or right of the center line, serving diagonally into the opponent's opposite service box.
                    * **The Execution:** The server must bounce the ball on the ground behind the service line and strike it **at or below waist height**.
                    * **The Bounce:** The served ball must land directly inside the opponent's diagonal service box.
                    * **The Walls on Serve:**
                    * If the ball bounces in the box and hits the **glass wall**, it is a good serve.
                    * If the ball bounces in the box and hits the **wire mesh fence**, it is a fault.
                    * If the ball hits the net and lands in the proper box, it is a **let** and is replayed.


                    * **Two Chances:** Just like tennis, the server gets a first and second serve.

                    ---

                    ## 3. General Play & Wall Rules

                    * **The Ground First:** During a rally, the ball must always bounce on the opponent's ground *before* hitting any of their walls or fences. If it hits a wall or fence directly without bouncing first, it is out.
                    * **Volleys:** Players can volley the ball (hit it before it bounces) at any point during a rally, except directly returning a serve.
                    * **Using Your Own Glass:** You are allowed to hit the ball against the **glass walls on your own side** of the court to send it over the net to the opponent's side. You *cannot* hit it against your own wire mesh fence.
                    * **Double Bounces:** Once the ball bounces twice on either side, the point is over.

                    ---

                    ## 4. Scoring System

                    Padel uses the exact same scoring structure as traditional tennis:

                    * **Points:** `0` $\rightarrow$ `15` $\rightarrow$ `30` $\rightarrow$ `40` $\rightarrow$ `Game`.
                    * **Deuce:** At 40-40, a team must win by two consecutive points (Advantage $\rightarrow$ Game).
                    * *Alternative Golden Point Rule:* Some tournaments use a "Golden Point" (sudden death) at 40-40, where the receiving team chooses which side to receive, and whoever wins that single point wins the game.
                    * **Sets and Matches:** A standard match is typically the **best of 3 sets**. Each set is won by the first team to reach 6 games (leading by 2). If the score reaches 6-6, a 7-point tiebreak decides the set.
