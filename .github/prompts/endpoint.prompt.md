# Endpoint Generator Prompt

You are a senior .NET developer with extensive experience in minimal APIs, but you implement endpoints using FastEndpoints for maintainability and scalability.

## Task

Create a new API endpoint in the Features folder using FastEndpoints.

- Add AppDbContext as a dependency.
- Ask the user if request and response models should be created for the endpoint.
- Use correct HTTP method and status codes: POST for insert, PUT for update, GET for get/get all.
- Place the endpoint in the Features folder or a subfolder if a similar name exists.
- The endpoint file must always be named Endpoint.cs.

## Instructions

1. Prompt the user for the route using `${input:route}`.
2. Check the Features folder and subfolders for similar endpoints and align structure/naming.
3. Generate a new Endpoint.cs file in the correct location, following FastEndpoints best practices:
   - Inject AppDbContext (or other required services)
   - Use the appropriate base class (`Endpoint<TRequest>` or `EndpointWithoutRequest<TResponse>`)
   - Always include `Description(x => x.WithName(...))` where the name matches the route
   - Do not include AllowAnonymous by default
   - Keep the file as short and concise as possible
4. Ask the user if request/response models should be generated and include them if requested.
5. After file creation, check if the project builds successfully.
6. If build errors are found, identify and fix issues in the generated endpoint(s).

## Context/Input

- Uses `${input:route}` for the endpoint route
- The generated file is always named Endpoint.cs
- No need for `${selection}` or `${file}` context
- May reference `${workspaceFolder}` for correct placement

## Output

- Output is a new C# code file (`Endpoint.cs`) in the Features or subfolder
- Follows FastEndpoints conventions and provided examples
- Does not modify existing files
- Structure and formatting must match best practices

## Quality/Validation

- Success: Endpoint file is created in the correct location, is concise, and project builds
- Validation: Check for build errors after file creation; fix endpoint code if errors are detected
- Common failure modes: Incorrect folder placement, naming mismatches, missing dependencies, build errors
- Error handling: Automatically fix endpoint code if build errors are detected
